# Releasing the native app

Builds run on **EAS Build** (Expo's infrastructure), not on GitHub's runners
and not on a laptop. Everything below is a one-time setup followed by a
one-click dispatch.

## One-time setup

### 1. The Expo project

```sh
cd native
npx eas-cli login
npx eas-cli init          # prints the project id
```

`eas init` normally writes the id into `app.json` — this app uses a **dynamic**
config (`app.config.js`), which it cannot write to, so the id is passed in
instead:

- **CI**: set it as the repository **variable** `EAS_PROJECT_ID`
  (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Variables).
- **Locally**: `native/.env` (`cp .env.example .env`).

### 2. The CI token

Create a **robot** access token at
`https://expo.dev/accounts/<account>/settings/access-tokens` — a robot cannot
sign in to the dashboard and owns no projects, so its blast radius is bounded —
and set it as the repository **secret** `EXPO_TOKEN`.

### 3. Store credentials

EAS holds these on the project, not in this repo:

```sh
npx eas-cli credentials          # iOS signing + Android keystore
```

For submission, fill in the placeholders in `eas.json` →
`submit.production`:

| Placeholder                 | Where it comes from                                                                                                                             |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `APPLE_ID_EMAIL`            | The Apple Account the Developer Program membership is under.                                                                                    |
| `APP_STORE_CONNECT_APP_ID`  | App Store Connect → the app → App Information → **Apple ID** (digits). Assigned when the app record is created, so the record must exist first. |
| `APPLE_TEAM_ID`             | developer.apple.com → Membership details → **Team ID** (10 characters).                                                                         |
| `play-service-account.json` | Play Console → Setup → API access → a service account key. Gitignored; upload it to EAS with `eas credentials` rather than committing it.       |

### 4. iOS capabilities

The app declares one iCloud container, `iCloud.se.agilator.time`.
Before the first store build, in the Apple Developer portal:

1. **Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles → Identifiers → iCloud Containers**
   — create the container with exactly that identifier.
2. **Identifiers → the app's App ID → iCloud** — enable the capability and
   tick that container.

An entitlement the App ID does not carry fails code signing, and — worse — a
container that signs but was never created resolves to nil at runtime: the app
builds, installs, launches, and reports iCloud as unavailable with nothing in
the log to say why.

## Cutting a build

Dispatch **Actions → native → Run workflow** and pick:

| Input      | Meaning                                                                                                                                |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `platform` | `ios` (the default), `android` or `all`.                                                                                               |
| `profile`  | `development` (dev client), `preview` (internal, APK + simulator), `testflight` (store-signed, still ours), `production` (what ships). |
| `submit`   | Also submit to the stores. Refused on anything but `production`.                                                                       |

The job builds the web app, packs it into `native/assets/webroot.zip`, and
queues the build on EAS with `--no-wait` — it exits immediately, so watch the
build itself at <https://expo.dev>.

The **marketing version** comes from the repo root's `package.json`, so the app
and the website never disagree about which release they are. Store **build
numbers** are auto-incremented by EAS (`appVersionSource: remote`); nothing is
bumped by hand.

## Doing it from a laptop instead

```sh
cd native
npm ci
npm run build:preview        # internal build
npm run build:testflight     # store-signed, to TestFlight
npm run build:production     # what ships
npm run submit
```

Each of those bundles the web app first — the wrapper serves that copy, and a
build without it launches to a blank screen.

## Checklist before a store build

- [ ] `make lint && make test && make build` is green at the repo root.
- [ ] `make native-typecheck` is green.
- [ ] `EXPO_PUBLIC_TIME_URL` is **unset** — a build that streams the website
      is the exact shape App Store guideline 4.2 rejects.
- [ ] The version in the root `package.json` is the one you mean to ship.
- [ ] On a real device signed into iCloud: **Settings → Cloud sync → iCloud
      Drive**, log a day, and see `time.json` appear under **Files → iCloud
      Drive → Time**. Then sign out of iCloud and confirm the app says so
      rather than losing the day.
