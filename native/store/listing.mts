// THE STORE LISTING'S RULES — everything about the submission that is not the
// marketing copy. Committed; the copy is not.
//
// THE SPLIT IS DELIBERATE AND IT IS ABOUT ONE FACT: the game is PAID on the
// App Store and OPEN SOURCE on GitHub. Those two are only in tension for the
// listing's WORDS. A product page's description, subtitle, promotional text
// and keyword set are what the store indexes and what a competitor reads, and
// publishing them in a public repository puts the paid listing's own copy on a
// crawlable page under somebody else's domain — competing with, and sometimes
// outranking, the listing it was written for. Nothing else here has that
// problem: an age-rating answer, a category, a field limit and a cross-check
// are all better off in the open, where a reviewer can see them.
//
// So:
//
//   listing.mts        THIS FILE. Types, limits, categories, the age-rating
//                      questionnaire, the release policy, and what the Steam
//                      page may not claim. Committed.
//   copy.mts           Every word a buyer reads. GITIGNORED.
//   copy.example.mts   The committed template that documents its shape, with
//                      obvious placeholder text.
//
// It is the same shape as `native/.env` beside `native/.env.example`, for a
// related reason — see `docs/configuration.md`. The generator compiles
// whichever of the two copy modules is present and says which one it used;
// `make store-preflight` reports running on the example as outstanding work,
// because a submission built from the template would ship placeholder prose.
//
// Compiled by `make store-metadata` (scripts/generate-store-metadata.mjs) into
// the files the upload tools read: native/store/store.config.json for
// `eas metadata:push`, the fastlane metadata tree for `fastlane deliver`,
// tauri/fastlane/metadata/ for the MAC App Store's own `deliver`, and
// tauri/store/steam-listing.md for the Steamworks store page. All of it is
// gitignored build output — never edit it.
//
// THREE STOREFRONTS, TWO SHELLS. The App Store's phone app is `native/` (Expo
// over a WebView); the Mac App Store's app and Steam's download are both
// `tauri/` (the desktop shell), because a Mac app is a desktop app and the
// Expo shell does not build one. Each store's assets sit beside the shell that
// submits them; the words are authored once, here and in `copy.mts`, because
// they describe one game.
//
// A TypeScript module rather than a YAML catalog, for the reason the rest of
// this repo's small fixed catalogs are (docs/spec-conformance.md, §24): the
// tests and the generator read the same typed rows with no schema layer and no
// parser dependency, and the identity it composes against
// (`pwa/src/identity.ts`) is a module, not a data file.
//
// TWO MORE KINDS OF FIELD, NEITHER OF WHICH IS HERE:
//
//   COMPOSED    the listing title, the marketing URL, the privacy URL and the
//               copyright line, which the generator takes from identity.ts, so
//               a rename reaches the store listing the same way it reaches the
//               manifest and the app's name.
//   OUT OF BAND the App Store review PHONE NUMBER. Apple rings it and this
//               repository is public, so it comes from `ASC_REVIEW_PHONE` in
//               the gitignored `native/.env` (scripts/lib/store-env.mjs). The
//               generator drops the field rather than upload a number that
//               rings nobody.
