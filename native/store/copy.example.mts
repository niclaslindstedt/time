// THE STORE COPY'S SHAPE — a committed skeleton, not a listing.
//
// The real words live in `copy.mts` beside this, which is GITIGNORED: a
// description, subtitle, promo text and keyword set are what the store indexes
// and what a competitor reads, so publishing them puts the listing's own prose
// on a crawlable page under somebody else's domain. `listing.mts` explains the
// split.
//
// THIS FILE IS DELIBERATELY NOT WRITING. Every string below is a placeholder
// naming what belongs there, short enough that nobody could mistake it for
// marketing and long enough to satisfy the field limits so a fresh clone
// typechecks and `make store-metadata` runs end to end. Do not improve the
// prose here — improving it would recreate exactly what the split exists to
// avoid, one adjective at a time.
//
// HOW TO WRITE THE REAL THING: load the `store-listing` skill. It carries the
// craft — what each field is for, every limit and which of them truncate
// silently, how the keyword budget is actually spent, the guideline 4.2
// argument the review notes have to make, and the traps. The knowledge is in
// the repository; the words are not.
//
//   cp native/store/copy.example.mts native/store/copy.mts
//   # …then follow the skill, and keep a backup outside this checkout.
