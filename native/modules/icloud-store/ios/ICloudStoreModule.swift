// THE iCLOUD DOCUMENT STORE, Apple side.
//
// Four operations over the app's own ubiquity container — list, read, write,
// remove — and a fifth that says whether the container can be used at all.
// That is the whole native surface the wrapper adds, and it is deliberately
// file-shaped: the web app's sync engine already speaks a store of files, so
// iCloud slots under the code path it uses for every other backend and no
// part of the time report's own logic is reimplemented here. This module
// moves bytes; what is IN them is the app's business.
//
// Three things make this less trivial than a folder on disk, and all three
// are ordinary states a real phone is in:
//
//   • THE FILE MAY NOT BE HERE YET. iCloud lists a file the moment another
//     device writes it, but the bytes arrive later. A plain read then returns
//     nothing and the app would conclude the container is empty — and
//     overwrite a perfectly good document with this device's copy. So a read
//     asks for the download and waits, bounded, for it to land.
//   • ANOTHER PROCESS IS WRITING IT. The sync daemon writes into the same
//     container we do, so every read and write goes through NSFileCoordinator
//     rather than straight at the file. Without it a read can see half a
//     document, which parses as nothing and is indistinguishable from an
//     empty one.
//   • iCLOUD MAY BE SIGNED OUT. Which is the reader's to fix, and a different
//     thing from the container failing to resolve at all — which is the
//     entitlements missing from the build, and the developer's. The two are
//     reported apart because the app says something different about each.
