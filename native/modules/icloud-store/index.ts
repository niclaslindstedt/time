// THE iCLOUD DOCUMENT STORE, JavaScript side.
//
// A small, file-shaped API over the app's own iCloud ubiquity container:
// list, read, write, remove. That is deliberately the same four operations
// the web app's storage layer already speaks (the framework's `FileStore`),
// so the page's sync engine drives iCloud with the code path it already uses
// for a folder — see `src/app/cloudHost.ts`.
//
// APPLE ONLY. There is no iCloud on Android and no pretending otherwise: the
// module declares `platforms: ["apple"]` and this resolves to `null`
// everywhere else, which the wrapper reports as "no store" and the page reads
// as "do not offer this backend".
//
// Loaded OPTIONALLY. A build without the native side — Expo Go, a bare
// `expo start`, a platform where autolinking did not pick it up — gets `null`
// and the app runs with the copy on this device rather than crashing at
// import.
