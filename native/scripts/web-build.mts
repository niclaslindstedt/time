 *  app's two build parameters on top.
 *
 *  `VITE_EDITION=store` is the channel: the build sold in the App Store, so its
 *  exported PDF specifications carry no "made with the free web edition"
 *  notice and the page carries no link back to the source. A caller may still
 *  set another edition explicitly.
 *
 *  `VITE_SHELL_BUILD=on` is the medium, and it is not negotiable: the site
 *  ships inside the binary, so there is no deploy for a service worker to
 *  discover and no update for the in-app prompt to announce — a new version
 *  arrives as a new build from the store. It is the flag the desktop shell
 *  builds with, and the phone app is the same shape of thing: a worker in the
 *  WebView would precache files already on the device and go on serving them
 *  after the store had delivered new ones.
 *
 *  `displayName` is the store listing's name, which the site shows wherever the
 *  app names itself, so the watch and the bar say what the icon says. */
