// Builds the web app and packs its `dist/` into one asset —
// `native/assets/webroot.zip` — that the wrapper bundles, unpacks on first
// launch and serves over a loopback HTTP server (src/local-server.ts). That is
// what makes the app self-contained: the time report runs entirely on-device,
// and changes only when a new build ships to the store.
//
// The web build is `npm run build` at the repo root — base `/`, which is
// exactly what a localhost origin wants — with two build parameters
// (`webBuildEnv` in `web-build.mts`). `VITE_EDITION=store` is the channel:
// this is the build sold in the App Store, so its exported PDF specifications
// carry no "made with the free web edition" notice (`src/app/edition.ts`) —
// and, as a build that is not the website, it carries no link back to the
// source (by owner decision): `vite.config.ts` leaves the web edition's
// address out of the page. `VITE_SHELL_BUILD=on` is the medium, and is the
// desktop shell's flag: the site ships inside the binary, so it has no service
// worker and no in-app update prompt — a new version arrives from the store.
// Nothing else in `src/` changes for the app. If the wrapper ever needs the web
// app to behave differently, that is a sign it has stopped being thin.
//
// It also passes the listing's name, `APP_DISPLAY_NAME`, which the web build
// shows wherever the app names itself (`src/app/appName.ts`) — so the watch
// and the bar say what the icon says. The process environment wins (CI takes
// it from the secret), then `native/.env`, then the project's own name
// (`identifiers.js`), which is what a fresh checkout builds under.
//
// The parameters are build-time, so `--skip-build` re-zips whatever the last
// build left in `dist/` — and a website build there names the web edition and
// carries the worker. The zip is refused when it does (`assertNoSourceLink`,
// `assertNoUpdateCycle`).
//
// Usage:
//   node scripts/bundle-web.mjs                 # build the site, then zip it
//   node scripts/bundle-web.mjs --skip-build    # re-zip an existing dist/
//   node scripts/bundle-web.mjs --profile production
//
// `--profile` is accepted (and echoed) so the release scripts and the CI
// workflow can pass the EAS profile through uniformly. It does not change the
// build today — the web app has no profile-dependent output — but the seam is
// where a "strip the developer menu from store builds" knob would land, and
// having the plumbing already correct is cheaper than retrofitting it.
//
// The zip is a build artifact (gitignored). Generate it before `eas build`;
// the root `.easignore` is what keeps it in the EAS upload despite that.
