// THE ONE PLACE A DEPLOYMENT'S COORDINATES ENTER THIS REPOSITORY.
//
// The repository is the project; a store listing is a deployment of it. So the
// listing's name and identifier are configuration, not source: they arrive as
// build variables and are never committed. What is committed is the project's
// own plain name and a development id, which is what a fresh checkout runs
// under.
//
//   APP_DISPLAY_NAME  the listing name, and the name under the icon
//   APP_BUNDLE_ID     iOS bundle identifier + Android package name
//   EAS_PROJECT_ID    the Expo project this builds against
//
// Each is a GitHub Actions secret the build workflow forwards, and an EAS
// environment variable on the project, because EAS resolves the config again
// on its own builders. The names are identical in every app in the fleet, so a
// secret is pasted rather than translated.

// THE iCLOUD CONTAINER IS NOT THE BUNDLE ID, and deriving it from one would be
// a mistake. It names a container, registered once in the developer portal and
// addressed by the app and its native module; the listing it ships under is
// not its business. Deriving it would mean a plain checkout addressing
// `iCloud.dev.local.time` while the module's Swift — which cannot read a
// build variable — said something else, and a document store pointed at the
// wrong container syncs nothing while reporting success.
//
// So it is committed, identical in every build, and the Swift agrees with it
// by being the same string.
/** The iCloud Drive container the document syncs through. */
