// THE AUTH-SESSION BRIDGE: how the page signs in to a cloud provider from
// inside the app.
//
// The page is served in a WebView from a loopback origin, and its OAuth
// redirect flow cannot finish there. The providers refuse to show consent in
// an embedded WebView, so `App.tsx` sends every off-origin page to the system
// browser — and the provider then redirects THAT browser to
// `http://localhost:8261…`: an origin it does not have registered, in a
// browser that does not hold the PKCE verifier the page stashed in its own
// `sessionStorage`. Signing in to Dropbox could never complete.
//
// The platform's own answer is an AUTHENTICATION SESSION
// (`ASWebAuthenticationSession` on iOS, a Custom Tab on Android): a browser
// sheet over the app that closes the moment the provider redirects to a URI
// the app claims, and hands that URI back. This wrapper offers one to the
// page as a CAPABILITY — `window.__ossAuthSession`, the seam the framework's
// storage module looks for (`getAuthSessionHost` in
// `@niclaslindstedt/oss-framework/storage`). A browser has no such host and
// keeps its redirect flow; the desktop shell has none and keeps its loopback
// one. The page never asks what it is running inside.
//
// The wrapper decides nothing about the sign-in. It opens a URL and hands back
// where the sheet ended: the PKCE challenge, the `state` check and the token
// exchange all stay in the page, which is also the only place the tokens ever
// exist.
//
// Same shape as `icloudBridge.ts`: this file exports STRINGS for the page
// (dependency-free, ES5-ish — nothing in them is transpiled) plus the pure
// narrowing and settling helpers, and it is exercised from the root test
// suite, so it imports nothing that reaches `expo`.
