// ANSWERING THE PAGE'S STORE REQUESTS — the native half of the iCloud
// backend, and the thing this wrapper adds to the web app.
//
// That is deliberate, and it is what makes this an app. App Store guideline
// 4.2 rejects a build that is a viewer for a website, so the wrapper has to do
// things the browser cannot: it serves the time report from inside the
// download (works with no network at all), and — here — it keeps the document
// in the reader's own iCloud, which no browser can do because no browser can
// reach a device's ubiquity container.
//
// What this module is NOT allowed to do is decide anything about the time
// report. It moves bytes: a file in, a file out. Which day is short, what a
// break counts for and how two devices' edits reconcile are all the web app's
// (`src/app/day.ts`, `report.ts`, `merge.ts`) — a Swift copy of any of that is
// exactly the drift `AGENTS.md` forbids.
//
// Every answer leaves here as DATA rather than as a rejection. The only
// channel back into the page is an injected script, and an exception thrown
// there is swallowed by the WebView instead of reaching the promise — so a
// failure is a `{ ok: false, kind }` the page turns back into the right
// framework error.

 *   • `offline` — the container is there but the bytes are not, which is what
 *     a phone with no connection looks like. The app keeps the copy on this
 *     device and says so, instead of treating an unreachable container as an
 *     empty one and pushing over what is in it.
 *   • `error` — everything else, which the app shows and stops on.
