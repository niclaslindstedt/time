// THE iCLOUD BRIDGE: how the page reaches the user's own iCloud container.
//
// The web app never learns it is running inside this wrapper. What it does is
// look for a DOCUMENT-STORE HOST on `window` — a capability, not an identity —
// and this is the script that installs one (see `src/app/cloudHost.ts` for the
// other side of the contract). A browser has no such host, so on the website
// the picker offers Dropbox and iCloud is simply not there.
//
// `react-native-webview` gives us one message channel in each direction: the
// page posts strings out, and the app injects scripts in. That is enough for
// request/response as long as each call carries an id, so this module is:
//
//   • a script that defines `window.__timeCloudHost`, whose five methods post
//     a request out and return a promise;
//   • `isCloudRequest`, which narrows an inbound message; and
//   • `resolveScript`, which builds the one line of JavaScript that settles
//     the promise back in the page.
//
// Like `injected.ts`, this file exports STRINGS. Keep the page-side code
// dependency-free and ES5-ish — it runs in the WebView, not in Metro's
// bundle, so nothing in it is transpiled or polyfilled.

// From `icloudWire.ts`, NOT from `icloud.ts`: this module is pure and is
// exercised by the root test suite, which runs against an install that has no
// `expo` in it. Importing the types from their reader — even as a type-only
// import — puts expo back in the root's type graph and turns CI red on a
// machine where it passes.
