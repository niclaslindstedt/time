// THE SAVE-FILE BRIDGE: how an export leaves the app.
//
// On the web an export is a download — an anchor clicked at a `blob:` URL.
// Inside this WebView that click goes nowhere: the WebView offers the `blob:`
// URL to `App.tsx` as a navigation, and nothing on the phone can open a URL
// that only exists inside the page. So the wrapper offers the page a
// CAPABILITY instead, the framework's `save-file` contract
// (oss-framework's `docs/native-shell.md`): it advertises it in
// `window.__ossShell` before the page loads, the framework's `saveFile` then
// posts the file's bytes here rather than downloading them, and `saveFile.ts`
// writes them to the cache and opens the share sheet — from which the reader
// saves the report to Files, AirDrops it or mails it.
//
// The page never asks what it is running inside: it asks whether the shell can
// save a file, and a browser (which advertises nothing) keeps its download.
//
// Same shape as `icloudBridge.ts` and `authSessionBridge.ts`: the STRINGS and
// the pure narrowing live here, and nothing that reaches `expo` — not even a
// type — so the root test suite can run them against the framework's own
// `saveFile` (see "What breaks quietly" in the agent guide); the effect that
// needs `expo` lives in `saveFile.ts`.
