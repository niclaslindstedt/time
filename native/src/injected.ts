// THE SCRIPT THE WRAPPER INJECTS TO WATCH THE PAGE'S CHROME.
//
// The web app is shipped unchanged — nothing in `src/` knows it is running
// inside a native shell, and that is the whole point of a thin wrapper. So
// the one thing native needs from the page is read from the *outside*, by this
// script, over `window.ReactNativeWebView.postMessage`: the RESOLVED THEME
// COLOURS, so the status bar and the safe-area bands match whichever theme
// the reader picked instead of being guessed at.
//
// Nothing else crosses this way. The wrapper does not copy the document out of
// `localStorage` and has no use for it: the iCloud backend is driven from
// inside the page (see `icloudBridge.ts`), which means the day's spans go
// straight from the app's own sync engine to the user's own container without
// this script ever seeing them.
//
// It also unregisters the service worker (see `SW_TEARDOWN`).
//
// This file exports STRINGS, not behaviour: `react-native-webview` takes the
// script as source text. Keep it dependency-free ES5-ish — it runs in the
// page, not in Metro's bundle, so nothing here is transpiled or polyfilled.

 * keeps answering from its precache after a store update has already unpacked
 * version N+1 into the webroot. The visible symptom is an App Store update
 * that changes nothing until the app is deleted and reinstalled.
 *
 * Everything is guarded: an older WebView with no `caches` or no
