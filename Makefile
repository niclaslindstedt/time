# --- the native wrapper (native/) -------------------------------------------
#
# A thin Expo/React Native shell that bundles this web app and serves it in a
# WebView, plus the iCloud Drive storage backend. It has its OWN dependency
# tree — `make install` at the root does not touch it — so every target here
# reaches in with `--prefix native`. Store builds run on EAS, by manual
# dispatch: .github/workflows/native.yml; see native/RELEASING.md.

native-install:
	npm --prefix native install

# Build the web app and pack it into native/assets/webroot.zip — the copy the
# wrapper serves. Required before any native build; CI does it for you.

# Regenerate native/ios and native/android from app.config.js and the config

# Local preview of what the Release workflow will write to CHANGELOG.md.

# The desktop shell (tauri/) — a thin Tauri wrapper around this same app.
#
# It has its own toolchain, so `make test` and `make lint` deliberately stop at
# its edge and these targets are how it is reached instead;
# .github/workflows/desktop-tauri.yml runs the two check targets on every push
# that touches it, so a tree somebody forgot to check is a red PR rather than a
# surprise at release time. Needs a Rust toolchain (https://rustup.rs) plus the
# platform's webview development libraries — see tauri/README.md.

# --- running it ---

# Build the site into tauri/webroot/, compile the shell, and run it. This is
# the one to reach for; the first run compiles the Rust world and takes a few
# minutes, every one after it is seconds.
tauri:
	npm run tauri

# The same, but WITHOUT rebuilding the site — it re-copies whatever dist/
# already holds. Much quicker while iterating on the Rust, and wrong the moment
# you have touched the app, so reach for plain `make tauri` when in doubt.
tauri-fast:
	npm run tauri:fast

# The site, bundled into the shell, without launching anything.
tauri-bundle:
	npm run tauri:bundle

# The shell's own npm tooling (the Tauri CLI). `make tauri` needs none of it —
# only packaging does, and the packaging targets run this for you.
tauri-install:
	npm run tauri:install

# --- checking it ---

# The decision layer. Needs no GUI libraries at all — that is the whole reason
# tauri/shell/ is a separate crate from tauri/src-tauri/.
tauri-test:
	npm run tauri:test

# clippy at zero warnings, BOTH crates (this one does need the libraries).
tauri-lint:
	npm run tauri:lint

tauri-fmt:
	npm run tauri:fmt

tauri-fmt-check:
	npm run tauri:fmt:check

# --- packaging it ---

# The installers for THIS machine's platform, into tauri/target/release/bundle
# — a .exe on Windows, a .dmg on macOS, a .deb and an .AppImage on Linux. The
# release workflow runs exactly this on one runner per platform.
#
# Pass anything `tauri build` takes through ARGS, e.g. cross-compiling on a Mac:
#   make tauri-package ARGS="--target aarch64-apple-darwin"
tauri-package:
	npm run tauri:package -- $(ARGS)

# The same, built with the debug profile. Minutes faster than the release one
# (no LTO, no stripping) and the bundles are much bigger — for answering "does
# this still package on my machine" without waiting for a shipping build.
tauri-package-debug:
	npm run tauri:package:debug -- $(ARGS)

# `cargo clean` — the Rust target directory is gigabytes once it has built a
# release. The bundled webroot is left alone; every build replaces it wholesale.
