# --- the native wrapper (native/) -------------------------------------------
#
# A thin Expo/React Native shell that bundles this web app and serves it in a
# WebView, plus the iCloud Drive storage backend. It has its OWN dependency
# tree — `make install` at the root does not touch it — so every target here
# reaches in with `--prefix native`. Store builds run on EAS, by manual
# dispatch: .github/workflows/native.yml; see native/RELEASING.md.

# Build the web app and pack it into native/assets/webroot.zip — the copy the
# wrapper serves. Required before any native build; CI does it for you.
