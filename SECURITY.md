# Security policy for time

## Supported versions

The latest release line on `main` receives security fixes. Older lines are
considered end-of-life.

## Reporting a vulnerability

**Do not open public GitHub issues for security problems.**

Instead, please report privately via [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/niclaslindstedt/time/security/advisories/new),
or by email to `niclas@agilator.se`.

## Response

We aim to acknowledge reports within 72 hours and provide a triage update
within 7 days.

## Disclosure

We follow coordinated disclosure: we will agree on a release window with the
reporter and credit them in the release notes (unless they request otherwise).

## Scope

In scope: any vulnerability in the published release of time. This app holds
a record of when a named person was at work, so the paths that decide who can
read it are the ones that matter most — the OAuth token handling for the cloud
backends (`src/app/useSyncEngine.ts`), what the synced document contains, and
anything that could leak a day off the device or into a log, a URL, or a third
party. A finding that the app sends data anywhere it does not say it does is
always in scope.

Out of scope: vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies (please report those
upstream).
