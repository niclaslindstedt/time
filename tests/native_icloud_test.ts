// THE WRAPPER'S HALF OF THE iCLOUD SEAM, pinned against the app's.
//
// `native/src/icloudBridge.ts` installs a document-store host into the page,
// and `src/app/cloudHost.ts` looks for one. Between them sit three strings —
// the property, the event, and the provider's name — and a mismatch in any of
// them fails SILENTLY: the backend simply never appears in the storage
// picker, on a device where the reader can see nothing wrong. So they are
// pinned here, from both sides.
//
// This test also guards the import discipline that lets it exist at all. A
// root `npm ci` does not install `native/`'s dependencies, so anything
// reachable from here that imports `expo` (or `react-native`) passes on a
// fully-installed machine and fails only in CI. A **type-only** import is
// still an import. `tsc` cannot guard it locally, so the two files' import
// lines are read instead — crudely, and on purpose, because that fails where
// it helps.
