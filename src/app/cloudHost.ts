// THE SEAM: where the app asks its host whether it can offer a document store
// of its own.
//
// A browser cannot reach a device's iCloud container — there is no such API —
// so on the website this seam is simply never filled and iCloud is absent from
// the storage picker entirely. The app-store build's WebView host fills it in
// (`native/src/icloudBridge.ts`), and so could any other host that one day
// wanted to.
//
// That phrasing is the important part. Nothing here asks whether the app is
// running natively, on which platform, or in which build — it asks whether a
// DOCUMENT-STORE HOST is present, which is a question about capability and
// not about identity. A second host offering the same five methods would light
// the same backend up with no change here, and the wrapper stays free to
// disappear without leaving a native-shaped hole in the app.
//
// What the app keeps either way is the DOMAIN. A host moves bytes: a file in,
// a file out. What is in them, how two devices' edits reconcile and what a
// day adds up to are `migrations.ts`, `merge.ts` and `day.ts`'s, exactly as
// they are for Dropbox and for Drive — which is why the host is adapted into
// the framework's `FileStore` below and then never spoken to again.
