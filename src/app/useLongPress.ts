// One hook for a screen rather than one per button, because the pills are a
// list that grows and shrinks and a hook may not be called in a loop. It
// hands back a factory — `press({ press, hold })` returns the handlers to
// spread on a button — and the press in flight is the screen's one press,
// because a finger is one finger.
//
// Three things make a hold behave: the click the press ends with is
// swallowed, so holding "Lunch" opens its form rather than also starting one;
// a pointer that wanders is a scroll rather than a hold and calls it off; and
// under a mouse the right button is the same gesture, which is where a desk
// looks for it. The text under the finger is not selectable (`styles.css`),
// which is what keeps the phone from putting a selection handle over the pill
// while it is held.
