# The app on a phone

The time report is a PWA first: open it in a browser, add it to the home
screen, and it is an app. `native/` is the other way in — the same web app,
wrapped thinly enough to ship through the **App Store** and **Google Play**,
and in exchange for that wrapper it gains one thing the browser cannot give
it: **iCloud**.

## What the wrapper is

A `WebView` and a loopback HTTP server, and very little else.

The whole web build is packed into the download (`assets/webroot.zip`),
unpacked on first launch, and served from `http://localhost:<fixed port>`.
Nothing is fetched. The app works on a plane, in a tunnel, and on a phone that
has never had a network — and it changes only when a new build ships to the
store, not when the website deploys.

Around that, the wrapper keeps the native chrome in step: the status bar and
the safe-area bands take the page's own theme, so a dark dial does not sit
under a white bar. Links out of the app open in the system browser. On Android
the hardware back button drives the WebView's history.

There is **no native UI**. Everything you see is the web app, unchanged, down
to the last pixel of the dial.

## iCloud

**Settings → Cloud sync** offers **iCloud Drive** beside Dropbox and Google
Drive, and only in the app — a browser has no way to reach a device's iCloud,
so on the website the option is simply not there.

Choosing it is all there is to it. There is no account to connect and no
window to grant anything in: the container belongs to the iCloud account the
phone is already signed into. From then on the document — one file,
`time.json` — is kept in the app's own iCloud folder, and every device signed
into the same account merges the same way two Dropbox devices do: day by day,
the later edit of each winning (see [`../sync.md`](../sync.md)).

The file lives under **Files → iCloud Drive → Time**, where you can open it,
copy it out, or delete it. That is deliberate: these are your hours, and a
copy you cannot see is a copy you do not control.

Two things it will tell you rather than guess about:

- **iCloud is signed out.** The app says so and offers to reconnect instead of
  failing quietly; signing in happens in iOS Settings, and the app re-checks
  every time you come back to it.
- **The file is in iCloud but has not arrived yet.** Another device wrote it a
  moment ago and the bytes are still coming down. The app waits, and if they
  do not arrive it keeps working from the copy on this device and says it is
  offline — it never treats a file it could not read as an empty one.

Android has no iCloud, so there the app is the web app served from inside the
download, with Dropbox and Google Drive as before.

## What the wrapper is not allowed to do

Two rules, and they are what keep the app and the website the same product:

- **Nothing in `src/` knows the wrapper exists.** The web app does not check
  whether it is native. It looks for a document-store _capability_ on
  `window` (`src/app/cloudHost.ts`) and offers the backend when one answers —
  which is why a second host could light the same option up, and why the
  browser shows no native-shaped hole.
- **The wrapper decides nothing about time.** It moves bytes. What a day adds
  up to, what a break counts for, and how two copies reconcile are the web
  app's, in `day.ts`, `report.ts` and `merge.ts`. A second copy of that
  arithmetic in Swift would drift the first week it existed.

## Building it

See [`../../native/README.md`](../../native/README.md) for the day-to-day, and
[`../../native/RELEASING.md`](../../native/RELEASING.md) for what a store build
needs.
