// Builds the website and copies its `dist/` output into `tauri/webroot/`,
// which the desktop shell serves from a private scheme (`shell/src/webroot.rs`).
// This is what makes the app self-contained: Time runs entirely on-device,
// offline, and changes only when a new binary ships.
//
// The build is a plain `vite build` with the default base `/`, which is exactly
// what a single-origin shell wants, and ONE environment variable changes it.
//
// VITE_SHELL_BUILD drops the service worker (see `vite.config.ts`). It is about
// the medium rather than the audience: a desktop build has no deployment to
// discover an update from — a new version arrives as a new binary — so a worker
// here would precache a copy of files already on local disk and poll a
// `version.json` that never changes. It also switches the in-app update prompt
// off, which would otherwise be a toast nobody can act on.
//
// That is BUILD-TIME, so `--skip-build` copies whatever the last build left in
// `dist/` — a webroot re-copied from a plain `npm run build` carries the
// worker. Every release path builds.
//
// Usage:
//   node scripts/bundle-web.mjs               # build the site, then copy
//   node scripts/bundle-web.mjs --skip-build  # re-copy an existing dist/
