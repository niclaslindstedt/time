//! The loopback OAuth redirect — the decisions half.
//!
//! The one thing a web page cannot do for itself. The app is served from the
//! `time:` scheme, and no OAuth provider will register a custom scheme as a
//! redirect URI. The way out is the one RFC 8252 prescribes for native apps:
//! send the user to the provider in their real browser, and catch the redirect
//! on a loopback listener the app opens for the occasion.
//!
//! The shell holds the socket and nothing else. It does not know which
//! provider is being connected, what scopes were asked for, or what the code
//! is worth — the framework's `runLoopbackAuth` builds the authorization URL, checks
//! `state`, and trades the code for tokens. The shell answers two questions,
//! on two reserved paths of the app's own scheme: "what URI can I be
//! redirected to?" and "what came back?". The page reaches them with a plain
//! `fetch` (the framework's `desktop-loopback.ts`, which owns the same two
//! paths).
