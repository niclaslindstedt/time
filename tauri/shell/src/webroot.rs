//! Serving the bundled website — the one module in this tree that would be
//! wrong to simplify.
//!
//! The site is served from a registered private scheme (`time://`, see
//! [`crate::config`]) handled in-process: no port to pick, no port to collide
//! with, no socket listening on the user's machine, and no window in which
//! another program could talk to it. Three properties matter and each is easy
//! to lose:
//!
//!  1. **One stable origin.** The user's days live in IndexedDB and their
//!     settings in `localStorage`, both keyed by origin. `time://` is a
//!     constant, so the days survive every update. A `file://` page (or a
//!     server on an ephemeral port) would hand the user a different origin —
//!     and an empty days — at some point.
//!
//!  2. **Correct Content-Type, from us.** The site is ES modules; a browser
//!     refuses a module served as anything but a JavaScript type, and the
//!     failure is a blank window rather than an error. So the type is mapped
//!     explicitly from the extension here rather than left to be inferred.
//!
//!  3. **No path escape.** The URL path is attacker-influenced in principle
//!     (any link the page follows), so the resolved file is checked to be
//!     INSIDE the webroot before it is read.
//!
//! **Property 3 is done twice here, and on purpose.** The path is first
//! normalized LEXICALLY — segments resolved, a `..` refused outright — and the
//! joined result is then canonicalized and checked to still start with the
//! root. Either half alone has a known hole: a lexical pass is defeated by a
//! symlink inside the webroot pointing out of it, and a prefix check on the
//! raw join is defeated by a `..` the filesystem resolves before the
//! comparison.
