//! The Time desktop shell — a window showing the bundled site, and nothing
//! else.
//!
//! **The page never learns it is inside this app.** No initialization script,
//! no injected globals, no commands: the website is served from a private
//! scheme and runs exactly as it does in a browser tab, which is why running
//! here needed no change to the app at all. Everything Time does — the
//! document, the settings, the sync engine — it does through the ordinary
//! browser APIs it already uses.
//!
//! Everything security-shaped is deliberate and none of it is Tauri's default:
//! the page gets no Tauri API (`withGlobalTauri` off), an almost-empty
//! permission list (`capabilities/default.json`), no commands to reach the
//! shell by, and a window pinned to our own origin (`window::navigation_guard`).
